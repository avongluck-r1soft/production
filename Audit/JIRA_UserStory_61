    We pay for servers at Softlayer
    These servers need to have perl monitoring script running
    These servers need to be configured in GreyLog
    These servers need to be monitored by StatusCake
    These servers need to be visible in CloudSkiff

    Until someone figures out how to automate this, we will take turns manually 
    updating a spreadsheet that is to be turned in on the 2nd 1st of every month 
    (gives us time to kill un-needed machines)
